# The Global Education Puzzle: Unpacking Out-of-School Rates and Pandemic Disruptions
The level of education students are able to obtain varies greatly around the world. We plan to explore how out-of-school rates compare between countries around the globe, including gender differences in out-of-school rates. Further, we are interested in the effect that the Covid-19 pandemic had on studentsâ€™ educational outcomes, as many students had trouble continuing their education during this time. We hope this project brings light to the educational inequities that were exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. We will use different methodologies from class to compare a variety of facets of our data, hoping to draw interesting conclusions visually.
